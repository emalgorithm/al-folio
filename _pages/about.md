I am a *machine learning researcher* at *Twitter* in London. In particular, our team works on fundamental and applied research around the topic of *graph neural networks* (GNNs). My current research focus is on designing new GNN models for graphs which evolve over time ([*dynamic graphs*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10637)), such as social networks, financial transaction networks, or recommender systems. Many times, it is the dynamic behaviour of such graphs which conveys important information which goes otherwise lost when considering only a static graph. Additionally, I am also interested in [*making GNNs scale*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11198) to very large (Twitter-scale) graphs.

Previous to my current position, I was working at *Fabula AI*, which was then [acquired by Twitter](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/twitter-bags-deep-learning-talent-behind-london-startup-fabula-ai/) in June 2019.

In June 2019, I graduated with a distinction from an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at *Cambridge University*. My thesis was on *graph deep learning models on RNA data*, under the supervision of Prof. *Pietro Li√≤* and Prof. *Michael Bronstein*. 

In June 2018, I graduated with a BEng in Computer Science from *Imperial College London*. During my time there, I interned in 2017 at *G-Research* and in 2018 at *Google* as a software engineer. During summer 2018, after my graduation, I worked with Prof. Michael Bronstein on *fake news detection* using *graph convolutional networks*.

I am also the co-founder of [*LeadTheFuture*](https://leadthefuture.tech/), a non-profit organization with the goal of helping talented Italian students in STEM to achieve their potential. Today LeadTheFuture counts more than 100 mentors (engineers, researchers and entrepreneurs) and 300 selected mentees.
