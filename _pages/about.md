I am an MPhil student in Advanced Computer Science at *Cambridge University*, currently working under the supervision of Prof. *Pietro Li√≤* and Prof. *Michael Bronstein* on *graph deep learning models on RNA data*. On the same topic, I have recently published a paper on [*ncRNA Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06515). At the same time, I am also working part-time as a data scientist for [*Fabula AI*](https://fabula.ai/).

In June 2018 I graduated with a BEng in Computer Science from *Imperial College London*. During my time there, I interned in 2017 at *G-Research* and in 2018 at *Google* as a software engineer. Last summer, after my graduation, I worked with Prof. Michael Bronstein on *fake news detection* using *graph convolutional networks*.

I am also the co-founder of [*LeadTheFuture*](https://leadthefuture.tech/), a non-profit organization with the goal of helping talented Italian students in STEM to achieve their potential. Today LeadTheFuture counts more than 140 mentors and mentees.
