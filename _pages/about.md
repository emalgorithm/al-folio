I am a *machine learning researcher* at *Twitter* in London. In particular, our team works on fundamental and applied research around the topic of *graph neural networks*. Previously, I was working at [*Fabula AI*](https://fabula.ai/), which was then [aquired by Twitter](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/twitter-bags-deep-learning-talent-behind-london-startup-fabula-ai/) in June 2020.

In June 2019, I graduated with a distinction from an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at *Cambridge University*. My thesis was on *graph deep learning models on RNA data*, under the supervision of Prof. *Pietro Li√≤* and Prof. *Michael Bronstein*. The thesis also lead to a paper on [*ncRNA Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06515) which has been published at the KDD workhop on deep learning on graphs. 

In June 2018, I graduated with a BEng in Computer Science from *Imperial College London*. During my time there, I interned in 2017 at *G-Research* and in 2018 at *Google* as a software engineer. During summer 2018, after my graduation, I worked with Prof. Michael Bronstein on *fake news detection* using *graph convolutional networks*.

I am also the co-founder of [*LeadTheFuture*](https://leadthefuture.tech/), a non-profit organization with the goal of helping talented Italian students in STEM to achieve their potential. Today LeadTheFuture counts more than 250 mentors and mentees.
