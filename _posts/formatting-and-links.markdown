description: An autoencoder for discrete structures
---
As part of the module "[Advanced topics in machine learning](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1819/R250/materials.html)", which I am attending as part of my MPhil at Cambridge, I had to give a presentation on the paper "[Grammar Variational Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01925)"(GVAE). The paper presents an autoencoder which improves state-of-the-art autoencoder for discrete structures, by using the idea that very often discrete structures can be generated from a syntax free grammar. They give the examples of molecules nd arithmetic expressions.
